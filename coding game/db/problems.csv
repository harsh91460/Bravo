_x000D_
The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:_x000D_
_x000D_
1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace._x000D_
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present._x000D_
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored._x000D_
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2)._x000D_
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`._x000D_

_x000D_
Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**.

This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`._x000D_

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population._x000D_
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation._x000D_
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population._x000D_
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction._x000D_
_x000D_
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_._x000D_

_x000D_
Here, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`._x000D_

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:_x000D_
_x000D_
1.  If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop._x000D_
2.  If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo._x000D_
3.  Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid._x000D_
_x000D_
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)._x000D_
_x000D_
**Quad-Tree format:**_x000D_
_x000D_
You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below._x000D_
_x000D_
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`._x000D_
_x000D_
If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**._x000D_
_x000D_
**Example 1:**_x000D_
_x000D_
**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\]\]_x000D_
**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]_x000D_
**Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:_x000D_
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree._x000D_

**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,1\],\[0,1\],\[1,1\],\[1,0\],null,null,null,null,\[1,0\],\[1,0\],\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]_x000D_
**Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids._x000D_
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value._x000D_
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value._x000D_

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure._x000D_

\[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null\]_x000D_

The flights are represented as an `n x n` matrix (not necessarily symmetrical), called `flights` representing the airline status from the city `i` to the city `j`. If there is no flight from the city `i` to the city `j`, `flights[i][j] == 0`; Otherwise, `flights[i][j] == 1`. Also, `flights[i][i] == 0` for all `i`._x000D_
3.  You totally have `k` weeks (each week has **seven days**) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we do not consider the impact of flight time._x000D_
4.  For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an `n x k` matrix called `days` representing this relationship. For the value of `days[i][j]`, it represents the maximum days you could take a vacation in the city `i` in the week `j`._x000D_
5.  You could stay in a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which will not be counted as vacation days._x000D_
6.  If you fly from city `A` to city `B` and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city `B` in that week._x000D_

_x000D_
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `""06 ""` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `""6 ""` is different from `""06 ""`._x000D_
_x000D_
**In addition** to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `""1* ""` may represent any of the encoded messages `""11 ""`, `""12 ""`, `""13 ""`, `""14 ""`, `""15 ""`, `""16 ""`, `""17 ""`, `""18 ""`, or `""19 ""`. Decoding `""1* ""` is equivalent to decoding **any** of the encoded messages it can represent._x000D_
_x000D_
Given a string `s` consisting of digits and `'*'` characters, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_._x000D_
_x000D_

**Explanation:** The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages  ""1 "",  ""2 "",  ""3 "",  ""4 "",  ""5 "",  ""6 "",  ""7 "",  ""8 "", or  ""9 ""._x000D_
Each of these can be decoded to the strings  ""A "",  ""B "",  ""C "",  ""D "",  ""E "",  ""F "",  ""G "",  ""H "", and  ""I "" respectively._x000D_

**Example 3:**_x000D_
_x000D_
**Input:** s =  ""2\* ""_x000D_

"722","remove-comments","Remove Comments","Medium","Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings `source` where `source[i]` is the `ith` line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `'\n'`._x000D_
_x000D_
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments._x000D_
_x000D_
*   The string `""// ""` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored._x000D_
*   The string `""/* ""` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `""*/ ""` should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string `""/*/ ""` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning._x000D_
_x000D_
The first effective comment takes precedence over others._x000D_
_x000D_
*   For example, if the string `""// ""` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored._x000D_
*   Similarly, if the string `""/* ""` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored._x000D_
_x000D_
If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty._x000D_
_x000D_

_x000D_
*   For example, `source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */ ""; ""` will not be a test case._x000D_
_x000D_
Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments._x000D_
_x000D_
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `""/* ""` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details._x000D_

*   (An integer could be positive or negative.)_x000D_
*   A let expression takes the form `""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr) ""`, where let is always the string `""let ""`, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression `expr`._x000D_
*   An add expression takes the form `""(add e1 e2) ""` where add is always the string `""add ""`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`._x000D_
*   A mult expression takes the form `""(mult e1 e2) ""` where mult is always the string `""mult ""`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2._x000D_

Additionally, for your convenience, the names `""add ""`, `""let ""`, and `""mult ""` are protected and will never be used as variable names._x000D_
*   Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.

The width at each index is `1`. You are also given two integers `volume` and `k`. `volume` units of water will fall at index `k`._x000D_
_x000D_
Water first drops at the index `k` and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index. Then, it flows according to the following rules:_x000D_
_x000D_
*   If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left._x000D_
*   Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right._x000D_

_x000D_
Here, **""eventually fall ""** means that the droplet will eventually be at a lower level if it moves in that direction. Also, level means the height of the terrain plus any water in that column._x000D_
_x000D_
We can assume there is infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array. Also, there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than one grid block, and each unit of water has to be in exactly one block._x000D_

**Explanation:**_x000D_
The first drop of water lands at index k = 3. When moving left or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower level. (By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus any water in that column.)_x000D_
Since moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. (A droplet  ""made to fall "" means go to a lower height than it was at previously.) Since moving left will not make it fall, it stays in place._x000D_
 _x000D_
The next droplet falls at index k = 3. Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left. Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left, even though it could move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.)_x000D_
 _x000D_
The third droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. Since moving right would eventually make it fall, it moves right._x000D_

Finally, the fourth droplet falls at index k = 3. Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right. Since moving right would not eventually make it fall, it stays in place._x000D_

A **skiplist** is a data structure that takes `O(log(n))` time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists._x000D_
_x000D_
For example, we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:_x000D_

_x000D_
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than `O(n)`. It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is `O(log(n))` and space complexity is `O(n)`._x000D_

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance._x000D_

_x000D_
1.  In the beginning, `curOrder` will be `[ ""king ""]`._x000D_

_x000D_
The bombs are represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `bombs` where `bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. `xi` and `yi` denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the `ith` bomb, whereas `ri` denotes the **radius** of its range._x000D_

**Input:** n = 4, p = 0, banned = \[1,2\], k = 4_x000D_
**Output:** \[0,-1,-1,1\]_x000D_
**Explanation:** In this case `k = 4` so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is `0`. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is `-1`. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is `1`. _x000D_

**Input:** n = 5, p = 0, banned = \[2,4\], k = 3_x000D_
**Output:** \[0,-1,-1,-1,-1\]_x000D_
**Explanation:** In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is `0`. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray `[0, 2]` for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions `-1`. _x000D_
