# Bravo – Competitive Coding Challenge Platform (LLM-Powered)

**Bravo** is a web-based **competitive coding platform** built to make programming practice **interactive, social, and challenge-driven**, rather than isolated and monotonous. The platform focuses on **head-to-head competition**, allowing users to challenge friends, solve problems under time constraints, and improve through direct performance comparison.

Unlike traditional coding platforms that emphasize solo problem solving, Bravo is designed to **simulate real competitive programming scenarios** in a controlled, game-like environment. The primary goal is to encourage consistent practice, sharpen logical thinking, and provide measurable improvement through competition.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **1v1 Friend-Based Coding Challenges**
  Compete directly with friends in time-bound coding matches.

* **Online Code Editor**
  Write and submit code directly on the platform with support for multiple programming languages.

* **Automated Code Evaluation**
  Submissions are evaluated against predefined test cases with instant verdicts such as Accepted, Wrong Answer, or Runtime Error.

* **Competitive Match Flow**
  Challenges are designed to test speed, accuracy, and problem-solving efficiency under pressure.

* **Scoreboard & Performance Tracking**
  Track wins, losses, and overall performance across multiple matches.

* **Game-Inspired Experience**
  Competitive structure influenced by multiplayer gaming mechanics to keep users engaged.

## 🧠 LLM Integration (AI Mentor)

Bravo integrates a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to improve the learning experience without encouraging cheating.

* Provides clear and structured **problem explanations**
* Generates **context-aware hints** instead of full solutions
* Analyzes submitted code to identify **logical mistakes**
* Explains *why* a solution fails, not just that it fails
* Suggests conceptual improvements and optimization strategies

The LLM acts as an **AI mentor**, demonstrating reasoning patterns rather than outputting ready-made answers.
